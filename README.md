Hi 👋
These are two small projects I built while learning and practicing coding.

Project 1

This project was created to improve my understanding of basic structure and layout.
I focused on writing clean code and making it simple and easy to understand.

Project 2

This project helped me practice styling and organizing files properly.
I tried to make it look neat while keeping the code beginner-friendly.

I’m still learning and improving every day.
More projects coming soon 🚀
